# Project
### About
The content of the project is to predict the selling price of houses in the US. It will require you to use different strategies to do **data visualization, feature engineering, and model constructing**.
### Part 1
In part one we follow the instruction provided to do some data visualization and feature engineering. It mainly focus on how to efficiently pre-process the data.
### Part 2
In part two we can use different models and validation methods to predict the price and also check the model accuracy. I choose to use `random forest` with `5-fold validation` to get a relatively good performance.
